## Background
I workout at Kor Stength and Conditioning in North Park San Diego, and they have helped host an annual Kettlebell Sport competition called [Deck the Bells](https://www.mykorstrength.com/event/deck-bells-2018/). In 2017, I helped score this competition, which used an Excel sheet with information about the lifters, events, and scoring formulae, and a table (e.g. [2013 example](http://www.kettlebellathletica.com.au/ContentPages/ContentFiles/KBA_KETAcademyRankingTable.pdf)) describing which results qualify for official rankings. Scoring was challenging, as it lasted for 3-4 hours and was tiring and error prone to manually score. I had to recheck my scoring and ranking several times to make sure they were accurate. Given these challenges, we still improved the process by scoring during the competition, which previous volunteers had not done (they waited until the end to do the scoring, and lifters and spectators had to wait some time). I knew I would be helping out in 2018, so I wanted to improve this process and make my job easier.

[This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aGky8RFlp1WAFRoH3UbYcKeWqH1RheThT5GGc1YELlg/edit?usp=sharing) describes the requirements I set for myself. I had about 3-4 months before the 2018 competition.
